Dual number implementation until the fourth order.

The prod function need the dimension along which the produc is computed.
For instance use prod(A(:),1) instead of prod(A(:))

Do not use subsref or A(:,...) inside the '@dualx' folders (x=1,...,4).
For this case use the takepart function. Also, use the setpart function
instead of subsasgn if necessary.

Do not use ketA = A(:) inside the '@dualx' folders to build a ket vector
from the elements of A, use ketA = ket(A) instead.

Do not use numel for dualx (x=1,2,3,4) arrays, this function is not
overloaded. Use product(size(A)) instead.

The power function is a complicated function to code. If something is not
going as expected, chances are that this function is the cause.

Although care has been taken on writing the Matlab code, 
there is not guaranteed to be free of error. The use of the dual 
classes it is entirely at the user's risk and the author disclaims all 
liability.
